## ⏱ Task Completed: Stopwatch Web Application

### I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully built a Stopwatch Application as part of my web development practice! 🚀

In this project, I created a fully functional stopwatch that:

- Starts, stops, and resets with a single click

- Displays time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds

- Has a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design

- Is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only

💡 Through this project, I strengthened my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills, learned about setInterval() and clearInterval(), and improved my ability to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
